# CampusRecruitmentML
Predicting the Placement Status Using Different Classification Algorithm Techniques 

## Features
- Predicts student placement status based on various features using multiple classification algorithms.
- Utilizes a dataset (`Placement_Data_Full_Class.csv`) containing student academic and demographic information.
- Includes a Jupyter notebook (`Campus Recruitment.ipynb`) for data analysis and model training.
- Contains a smoke test artifact (`ai_git_assist_smoke_test.txt`) for validating repository update workflows (dry-run verification).
- Regular checks are performed to ensure repository integrity.

## Usage
1. Clone the repository:
   git clone <repository-url>
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   cd CampusRecruitmentML
3. Install the required packages (if using a virtual environment):
   pip install -r requirements.txt
4. Open the Jupyter notebook:
   jupyter notebook Campus\ Recruitment.ipynb
5. Run the cells in the notebook to load the dataset, preprocess the data, and train the classification models.

## Configuration
- Ensure that the dataset file `Placement_Data_Full_Class.csv` is located in the correct directory as specified in the Jupyter notebook.
- Modify the file path in the notebook if necessary to match your local setup.
